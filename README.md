# AI Vision Drone

Companion-computer vision/AI upgrade for an existing, already-flying RC drone (RC → receiver → flight controller (ArduPilot) → ESCs → motors — unchanged). Adds a Raspberry Pi 5 + Raspberry Pi AI Camera as a vision/AI companion computer, and a native Android Ground Station app, without replacing the flight controller or taking direct motor control.

Full technical development plan (architecture, milestones, acceptance criteria, safety design): see the plan document referenced in project notes. High-level layout:

```
/companion   Python 3.11+ asyncio app running on the Pi 5 (vision, tracking, guidance, MAVLink bridge, comms, safety supervisor)
/android     Native Kotlin Ground Station app (video, target selection, telemetry, health, abort)
/sim         ArduPilot SITL harness + synthetic camera/target generator for testing before real flight
/docs        Protocol spec, safety case, hardware wiring notes
/tools       Camera calibration, IMX500 model conversion scripts
```

## Guiding priority

**STABLE → LOW LATENCY → ACCURATE → EFFICIENT → SAFE.**

The flight controller remains the sole flight authority at all times. RC override is absolute and never depends on the Pi being alive.

## Status

Early scaffolding — no functional code yet. See `docs/` for the protocol spec and safety case as they're written milestone by milestone.
