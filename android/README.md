# Android Ground Station

Native Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, single-activity app (docs plan M6). Talks to
the Pi's `companion/comms` layer: a WebSocket control/telemetry channel and
a separate WebRTC video channel, per `docs/protocol.md`.

## Status

**Builds, runs, and works end-to-end** - confirmed live on a real device
against the Pi's sim companion stack over real WiFi: connects, streams
synthetic video, drag-to-select correctly initializes tracking on the
target, and the tracking overlay updates live. This project's dev
environment has no Android SDK, so every fix below came from you pasting
back a real build/runtime error - that's the expected way this gets
verified from here on out.

Fixed so far:
- **Kotlin/Compose plugin version mismatch**: `org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose`
  only exists from Kotlin 2.0.0 onward. Bumped `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android`
  and `org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose` to 2.0.21 together.
- **Invalid `spacedBy` import** in `ModeControls.kt` and `HealthPanel.kt` -
  `Arrangement.spacedBy` is a member of `Arrangement`, not a top-level
  function; fixed to import `Arrangement` and call it properly.
- **16 KB page-size alignment warning** - `stream-webrtc-android:1.1.1` and
  a transitive `androidx.graphics:graphics-path` were both built before
  Google's 16 KB native-library alignment requirement. Bumped
  `stream-webrtc-android` to 1.3.10, pinned `graphics-path` to 1.1.0
  explicitly, bumped the Compose BOM to 2025.12.01, and dropped 32-bit ABIs
  (`armeabi-v7a`/`x86`) since a phone/tablet ground station only needs
  arm64 - GetStream's own alignment fixes reportedly lagged for 32-bit for
  a while, so this sidesteps that entirely rather than chasing it further.
- **AAR metadata errors from the Compose BOM bump** - Compose 1.10.0 (pulled
  in by the BOM bump above) requires `compileSdk 35` and AGP `>= 8.6.0`,
  but the project was on `compileSdk 34` / AGP 8.5.2. Bumped AGP to 8.9.0
  (supports up to API 35, needs Gradle >= 8.11.1 - wrapper updated to
  match), and `compileSdk` to 35. `targetSdk` deliberately left at 34 for
  now - that's a separate, larger decision (new runtime behavior opt-in)
  from just compiling against newer APIs.

Confirmed live (`COMPANION_MODE=sim python -m companion.main`, phone on the
same WiFi as the machine running it): connect, video render, target
selection, tracking. Rebuild after the follow-separation/reconnect changes
above also confirmed working. **Not yet specifically exercised live**:
Follow mode's separation override actually changing behavior, Approach-Test
mode, the abort button's effect on an active mode, and reconnect after a
real dropped link (only smoke-tested via instrumented tests below, which
this environment can't run either).

## Layout

```
app/src/main/java/com/aivisiondrone/groundstation/
  comms/        Protocol.kt (wire schema, mirrors companion/comms/protocol.py),
                GroundStationClient.kt (OkHttp WebSocket client), JsonExt.kt
  video/        WebRtcClient.kt (receive-only WebRTC peer connection)
  control/      TargetSelectionOverlay.kt (drag-to-select), TrackingOverlay.kt
                (bbox/id/confidence), ModeControls.kt, AbortButton.kt
  telemetry/    TelemetryModels.kt, TelemetryPanel.kt, HealthPanel.kt
  ui/           GroundStationScreen.kt (top-level layout)
  MainActivity.kt, MainViewModel.kt (MVVM glue)

app/src/androidTest/java/com/aivisiondrone/groundstation/
  GroundStationScreenTest.kt (instrumented Compose UI tests - abort
  reachability, mode controls, drag-gesture smoke test)
```

## Known gaps

- ~~Follow-mode separation slider is UI-local only~~ - fixed: `setMode`/
  `setFollowSeparation` now send `follow_separation_m` on `mode_command`,
  and the Pi applies it live to the running `FollowController` (see
  `docs/protocol.md`). Not yet tried against a live Follow session on
  a real phone.
- ~~No reconnect/retry logic on WebSocket drop~~ - fixed: `GroundStationClient`
  tracks `shouldAutoReconnect` (true after `connect()`, false after an
  explicit `disconnect()`), and `MainViewModel` retries every 3s while a
  drop is unexpected. Not yet tried against a real dropped link (e.g.
  walking out of WiFi range).
- ~~No instrumented (Espresso) tests yet~~ - added
  `app/src/androidTest/.../GroundStationScreenTest.kt`: abort-button
  reachability (on launch and after a mode switch), mode controls visible,
  and a drag-gesture smoke test. **Not yet run** - this dev environment has
  no emulator/device to run instrumented tests on; run via Android
  Studio's test runner or `./gradlew connectedAndroidTest` on a connected
  device.
